        </span>
        <p>My name is <strong>Kalle Diop Niang</strong>, AKA kallzo... I like fried chicken, <em>but who doesn't</em>...
        </p>
        <p>I'm a self-taught programmer. Because, why not. I love programming, and computers, and anything related to
          tech...</p>
        <p>I just turned <del>27</del>, (actually that was last year, now I'm 28) and I remembered that when I was a
          kid, probably around 2, I said to myself
          &quot;I'm
          gonna make a really ugly website when I turn 27&quot;.</p>
        <p>That's not actually true, I don't even remember where I was, or what I was doing when I was 2.</p>
        <p>So, if you remember something about yourself when you were 2, feel free to tell me. Unless you're actually a
          2 year old, then you might wanna tell me how is it that you can use the internet and type things.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>You might be wondering &quot;<em>What the heck is this?</em>&quot; Well, I've been wondering the same
          thing...
        </p>
        <p>So, this is just a simple project, I think it's supposed to be about me, but even I don't know what I'm
          about...</p>
        <p>Does it look ugly? Yes, but I'm also ugly, so it makes sense.</p>
        <p>It didn't take me long to make this at all, and there are no frameworks involved...</p>
        <p>Just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Who knows, maybe I'll work on it and make it look prettier... I doubt that'll happen though.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Contact Info</h2>
        <p>You wanna know where I live, don't you?</p>
        <p>It's fine I'm gonna tell you...</p>
        <p>E-mail: kallzo@outlook.es</p>
        <p>Phone: (+33) 758 08 96 58</p>
        <p>You can also find me on Twitter (actually I just remembered that I quit Twitter), so I guess it's Instagram
          (until I quit), but don't don't worry, I'm not quitting github, I'll always be there for you.</p>
        <p>Sorry Facebook, You didn't make the cut... But now that I think about it, you kinda did, since you own
          Instagram... Oh well.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me...</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Well, this looks terrible... Any ideas?</p>
        <p>You know, Maybe I need a little bit of inspiration.</p>
        <p>But before inspiration comes, let's just try and focus on the bright side of things, like how beautiful this
          page looks. I mean, have you ever seen anything like it? This is a masterpiece design.</p>
        <p>So if you need someone to fix you up something like this, just hit me up, I'll be glad to cover your entire
          life with some style.</p>
        <p>Did I tell you where I live? No I didn't... Peace</p>
